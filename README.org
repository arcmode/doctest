#+TITLE: doctest

A Clojure library designed to provide docstring-driven testing for clojure.

Inspired by the python library [[https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html][doctest]]  and [[https://github.com/Kobold/clj-doc-test/][clj-doc-test]], currently
provides almost the same functionality but I'm planning to experiment with
features like mocking and reporting.
